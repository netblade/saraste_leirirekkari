Saraste leirirekkari
====================

Saraste 2012 scoutcamp person registry, built on top of Pyramid_ and SQLAlchemy_.

Built only for that camp and shouldn't be used for anything else straightforward. But if you must, feel free to take ideas and so forth.

There is going to be a follow up project for more generic person registry for summer camps, if you would like to participate, contact NetBlade_.

Saraste leirirekkari
====================

Saraste 2012 scoutcamp person registry, built on top of [Pyramid](http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/dev/) and [SQLAlchemy](http://www.sqlalchemy.org/).

Built only for that camp and shouldn't be used for anything else straightforward. But if you must, feel free to take ideas and so forth.

There is going to be a follow up project for more generic person registry for summer camps, if you would like to participate, contact [NetBlade](mailto:netblade@iki.fi).
